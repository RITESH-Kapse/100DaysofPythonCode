# Random Password Generator

Here we are going to get the output in two forms as 

#Eazy Level - Order not randomised:

#e.g. 4 letter, 2 symbol, 2 number = JduE&!91

#Hard Level - Order of characters randomised:

#e.g. 4 letter, 2 symbol, 2 number = g^2jk8&P



But easy level code I am commenting in """code""". So kindly uncomment the code if you want to play around.
